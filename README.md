Miniconda Python 3.10.19; Installed packages: Jupyter Lab, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, HyperSpy, py4DSTEM

**Week 1:**

**py4DSTEM has not been properly installed, so the assignment was done using Google Colab.**

**Week 2:**

**Virtual detectors enable post-acquisition imaging by utilizing the rich data captured in 4D-STEM, where a complete 2D diffraction pattern is recorded for every pixel in the scan. Unlike traditional STEM, which relies on fixed physical hardware to integrate signals during the experiment, 4D-STEM allows users to apply software "masks" (virtual apertures) to the recorded diffraction patterns computationally. This means a single dataset can be reprocessed infinitely to generate any type of image—Bright Field, Dark Field, or specific diffraction contrasts—by simply selecting which scattered electrons to integrate, effectively simulating any detector geometry long after the sample has been removed from the microscope.**
