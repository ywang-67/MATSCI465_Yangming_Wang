How do virtual detectors allow post-acquisition imaging?

Virtual detectors allow post-acquisition imaging by recording the diffraction pattern at each pixel in a scan, rather than just a total intensity value. This creates a comprehensive 4D dataset that enables researchers to apply software-based masks—simulating physical detectors of any shape or size after the experiments. Consequently, a single scan can be mathematically reprocessed to generate multiple image contrasts. This can optimize the visualization of specific material properties, such as lattice defects or phases, without additional radiation exposure to the sample.
